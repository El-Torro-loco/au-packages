    <summary>Self-contained daemon for reading local files and emitting remote syslog (without using local syslogd)</summary>
    <description>remote_syslog tails one or more log files and sends syslog messages to a
remote central syslog server. It generates packets itself, ignoring the system
syslog daemon, so its configuration doesn't affect system-wide logging.

Uses:

 * Collecting logs from servers &amp; daemons which don't natively support syslog
 * When reconfiguring the system logger is less convenient than a
   purpose-built daemon (e.g., automated app deployments)
 * Aggregating files not generated by daemons (e.g., package manager logs)

This code is tested with the hosted log management service [Papertrail]
and should work for transmitting to any syslog server.

remote_syslog2 is a rewrite of the ruby [remote_syslog] package. Not all
features of the ruby version are supported, and there are some backwards
incompatible changes.
